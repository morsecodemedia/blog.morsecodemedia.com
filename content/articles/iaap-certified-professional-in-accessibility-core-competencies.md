The IAAP Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC) credential is IAAP's foundational certification, representing broad, cross-disciplinary conceptual knowledge about 1) disabilities, 2) accessibility and universal design, and 3) accessibility-related standards, laws, and management strategies.

Relevant domains for the CPACC credential include the web and other digital technologies, architecture and the built environment, consumer and industrial design, transportation systems, and any domain in which thoughtful design, policy, and management can improve disability access. The CPACC Exam is a computer-based exam with 100 multiple choice questions and a two-hour exam administration (additional time may be requested as an accommodation).

The CPACC is the ideal credential for those who manage and support accessibility, but who may not personally design, implement, or evaluate the technical details of accessible solutions. For those who do work at the technical level, IAAP will be working to create domain-specific professional credentials which build on the associate-level credential. The IAAP will add other technical professional certification credentials in other domains in accordance with market and professional demand.
